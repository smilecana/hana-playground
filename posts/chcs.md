### WHAT DO YOU WORK?

- I updated the layout to meet usability and performance requirements by redesigning the existing service following the web standards recommended by **W3C**. As a result,discomfort was reduced by more than 20% for people with disabilities using the service.

- I created a language field comparison program for **multilingual services**, resulting in an 80% faster process for adding new languages to the services.

- I added the **karate testing framework** to the system and tested the service with user cases.

- I debugged regular issues arising from the service, resulting in a 10% increase in user satisfaction over three months.

- I also implemented a multilingual service on the web service to support eight countries.
