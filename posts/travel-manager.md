# Summary

Many people book hotels or airlines online and keep reservation information in files. However, sometimes these files can be accidentally deleted or duplicated, causing errors. That's why I'm developing an app specifically designed to organize reservation files and reduce user mistakes. The app will help users easily manage their reservations and ensure that they have access to the correct information at all times.
