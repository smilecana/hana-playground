### WHAT DO YOU LEARN?

We discussed what type of web service to build and decided to implement a project using the MERN or MEAN stack. I discussed with my team members what topics to carry out the project, and implemented the service in a way that they are most familiar with. After considering the pros and cons of both stacks, we decided to build the service using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. This stack was chosen because it is familiar to the team members and offers the necessary tools and features to build the desired service.

### WHAT DO YOU DIFFICULT?

A remote project prevented all team members from participating. To ensure everyone was up-to-date, we took notes during meetings and shared them with team members who were unable to attend. Additionally, the project code quality was improved through pair programming or code review, as team members had different levels of development.
