### WHAT DO YOU LEARN?

I discussed with the team about creating personas, scenarios, story maps, and user flows using **Figma**. I learned how to use the **react-emojis library** and tested the **Stripe** payment process that was implemented in the service.

### WHAT DO YOU DIFFICULT?

By conducting **non-face-to-face projects**, there were times when it was difficult to proceed with meetings involving all team members. Therefore, we shared as many opinions as possible on the project during online class when we could gather together. In addition, the project was carried out using Teams or Figma.

The university provided the team with a one-month project period, but the actual project period was two weeks. I had a meeting with the team members about the **time issue**. Most of them were positive about working overtime.
