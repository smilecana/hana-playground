### WHAT DO YOU WORK?

- I managed **RESTful API** endpoints for applications provided by companies and created APIs for new applications.

- I created a childrenâ€™s menu board (in kiosk form) using **HTML5** & **CSS3** with added animations, resulting in a 5% increase in sales by catering to the interests of children.

- The back-end language used was Java with the **Spring Framework**, while **Angular.js** and **jQuery** were utilized for the front-end language.
