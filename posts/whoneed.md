# Summary

One of the my project was made munuboard for children. the customer just want to display food menu and food menu explain I have carried out a project to make a menu that children can check. They just wanted to show the kids the menu, but I thought about ways to make them a little more interested in the menu, and I added a little fish moving on the menu. As a result, I was able to get positive feedback that children were interested in looking at the menu.
