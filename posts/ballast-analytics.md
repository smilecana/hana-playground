### WHAT DO YOU LEARN?

The main purpose of the exercise is to learn **leadership** and **develop skills in web service management** while working on the project. I discussed with the team how the service would be organized to proceed with the project, and I implemented the additional requirements of the customer in the existing web service.

### WHAT DO YOU DIFFICULT?

It was my first time understanding **Next.js** and **GraphQL**, so I needed to study them. To solve this problem, I took two weeks of research and shared the skills with the team members. Finally, in the third week of the project, I was able to understand these two techniques and apply them to the project.

By conducting **remotely managed projects**, there were times when it was difficult to proceed with meetings involving all team members. Therefore, we shared as many opinions as possible on the project during online classes when we could gather together. In addition, the project was carried out using Teams or Figma.
